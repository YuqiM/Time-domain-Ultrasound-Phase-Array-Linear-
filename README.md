#This file defines an array of Ultrasound Transducer and Propagate the Acoustics Waves in 3D FreeSpace
#The script alows you to set the starting phase of each element. You can also set the focal spot location and the script will automatically apply the required phase to each element of your ultrasound array
#The Mesh size can be easily redefined by changing the corresponding lines
#This is to explore the design space of the acoustics neural modulation device that I worked on, thus the code comments may be incomplete at this moment as I will add more complete instructions
